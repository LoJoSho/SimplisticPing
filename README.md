Why a ping plugin? Well, because I couldn't find a good one, that's why. SimplisticPing has

* MiniMessage Support
* Auto Tab Complete
* Updated to 1.18.1
* Permissions that make sense

There isn't any stupid stuff in it. No relying on other plugins for /ping or using Skripts. Just one simple plugin.

Permissions:

* simplisticping.use (Default: True)
* simplisticping.other (Default: False)
* simplisticping.reload (Default: True)
